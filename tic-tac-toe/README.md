# Tic Tac Toe
This is a project intended to test out if I'm competent enough to make the back-end of Tic Tac Toe. It is based on [the Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).

The code does not do everything in the requirements, simply because I believe I've accomplished what I set out to do; which is to make a decent back-end and also a little experiment in starting to use .css files. The front-end side is bare minimum.
