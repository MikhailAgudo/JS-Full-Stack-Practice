### Starting Projects
1. `npm init`
2. `npm install webpack webpack-cli`
3. .gitignore with "node_modules/"
4. make ./src/index.js
5. make ./dist/index.html
6. make ./webpack.config.js with:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```
7. have index.html reference main.js
8. use npx webpack --watch so you don't have to redo the same command

### General Plan
-/ task class/factory function
  has title, description, dueDate, priority, and step
-/ module that handles putting quests into the quest's task array
-/ module that sorts the tasks by priority and name
- module that initiates buttons and other UI-related functions
- module that handles tab-changing and such, tabs are in a sidebar;
  generally handle all UI stuffs
- expanding tasks is probably related to hovering and stuff
