### Starting Projects
1. `npm init`
2. `npm install webpack webpack-cli`
3. .gitignore with "node_modules/"
4. make ./src/index.js
5. make ./dist/index.html
6. make ./webpack.config.js with:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
};
```
7. have index.html reference main.js
8. use npx webpack --watch so you don't have to redo the same command

### General Plan
-/ task class/factory function
  has title, description, dueDate, priority, and step
-/ module that handles putting quests into the quest's task array
-/ module that sorts the tasks by priority and name
- module that initiates buttons and other UI-related functions
- module that handles tab-changing and such, tabs are in a sidebar;
  generally handle all UI stuffs
- expanding tasks is probably related to hovering and stuff
- localStorage:
  A module dedicated to saving: checks a value to see X amount of tasks, then saves on the next value.
    Like "task" + String(current) + mode, can mean "task5desc" and then loads the description of the 5th task
    might be important to assign the index of the quest in the name
  Recursion function to load them all back
