# Calculator
This is a small project, to make a fairly capable calculator based on (the Odin Project)[https://theodinproject.com/lessons/calculator]. The code does everything in the requirements and all the extra credits; save one. The project did not specify MDAS as a requirement, but this calculator will make use of it.
